# OpenCPI

OpenCPI is a non profit Club Penguin Island project aimed at open sourcing the recreated game's source code and parties, as well as updating the Unity engine to modern versions. We do not profit from Disney’s Club Penguin and Club Penguin Island properties, and we do not own the rights to these properties. All rights are owned by Disney and the respective copyright holders. If you are Disney or another entity that holds copyrights related to this project, please reach out to us, and we will take it down. We aim to avoid any legal issues.

In addition to preserving the game, we also aim at adding new features and fixing bugs present in the original game.

We’re excited to announce that the source code and party builds are now available.
